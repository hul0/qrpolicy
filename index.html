        <!-- Terms of Service Section -->
        <div id="terms-of-service" class="policy-section bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md mt-10">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 border-b pb-2">Terms of Service</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-500">Last Updated: July 30, 2025</p>
            
            <p>Welcome to QRWiz! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the QRWiz mobile application (the "Service") provided by Hul0 ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <h3>1. Description of Service</h3>
            <p>QRWiz is a mobile application that allows users to generate and scan QR codes. The Service includes a freemium model with virtual in-app currencies ("Coins" and "Diamonds"), rewarded advertisements, and an optional "Premium" subscription that provides an ad-free experience and other benefits.</p>

            <h3>2. User Accounts & In-App Currencies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Accounts: QRWiz does not require a formal user registration. Your data, including currency balances and history, is stored locally on your device. Consequently, if you uninstall the app or clear its data, your progress, currencies, and history may be permanently lost.</li>
                <li>Virtual Currencies: "Coins" and "Diamonds" are virtual points licensed to you for use within the Service. They have no real-world monetary value, cannot be redeemed for cash, and are not transferable. We reserve the right to manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate these virtual currencies at any time.</li>
                <li>Premium Service: The Premium subscription can be purchased using "Diamonds." This is a one-time, non-refundable purchase that unlocks premium features for the lifetime of the app on your device.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. User-Generated Content</h3>
            <p>You are solely responsible for the content you use to generate QR codes ("User Content"). You agree not to create QR codes that link to or contain content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, infringing, or otherwise objectionable. We do not monitor User Content but reserve the right to take appropriate action if we become aware of any violation of these Terms.</p>

            <h3>4. Prohibited Conduct</h3>
            <p>You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law.</li>
                <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise access the source code of the Service.</li>
                <li>Use any automated system to access or use the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to our servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period.</li>
                <li>Attempt to cheat or manipulate the virtual currency system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Advertisements</h3>
            <p>By using the free version of our Service, you consent to us and our third-party advertising partners (e.g., Google AdMob) displaying advertisements to you. These may include banner, interstitial, rewarded, and native ads. Opting for the Premium Service will remove these advertisements.</p>

            <h3>6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the operation or availability of the Service.</p>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Hul0 shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of the Service.</p>

            <h3>7. Termination</h3>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

            <h3>8. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>

            <h3>9. Changes to Terms</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of these Terms.</p>
